# 🌍 YouthForge — Build AI from Scratch (Student-Led)

> **Project Lead:** Mikiyas Olana(Ethiopia) 🇪🇹

**Short description**

AfroSystem is a student-led, long-term project to build an original AI system from the ground up. We’re assembling a global team of teenagers who want to learn, experiment, and build real systems together — from research prototypes to production-ready components.

---

## 🚀 Why this repo

This repo is the project home and the place where new contributors can learn about the vision, see project progress, and find tasks to start working on. If you want to join a serious learning team and help build an AI from scratch, start here.

---

## 🔹 Current status

* **Planning & early prototypes** (initial signup/login and project structure in progress)
* We’re focusing on: research experiments, small prototypes, and building a strong learning culture.

---

## 📋 What we’re looking for

We want **teenagers** who are serious, patient, and ready to commit. We value drive, curiosity, and consistency over perfect resumes.

**Preferred skills (strong preference):**

* Python (prototyping, ML research)
* C++ / C (performance & low-level implementations)
* C# / Java (optional — tooling, GUIs)
* Solid math & logic (linear algebra, calculus, probability/statistics, discrete math)
* Algorithms & data structures
* Basics of machine learning (supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement learning)

**Short, clear policy:**

> You don’t need perfect English or a fancy resume. What matters is that you show up, work hard, and keep learning.

## 🔧 Core requirements to build AI *from scratch*

(These are the areas contributors should learn and grow in while working on the project.)

* **Mathematics:** linear algebra (tensors/matrices), calculus (gradients/backprop), probability & stats, discrete math/logic.
* **Algorithms & Optimization:** gradient descent variants, numerical stability, convex vs nonconvex optimization, search/evolutionary methods.
* **Systems & Software Engineering:** multithreading, memory management, performance profiling, containerization, distributed training basics.
* **Low-level Implementation:** ability to write efficient numerical code (C/C++) and understand GPU acceleration.
* **Model Design & Research:** architecture design, loss functions, regularization, experiment design, reproducibility.
* **Data Engineering:** data collection, cleaning, labeling, pipelines, DBs (SQL/NoSQL).
* **Evaluation & Safety:** metrics, testing, validation, robustness, bias checks, ethical considerations.
* **Dev Tools:** Git, CI/CD basics, unit testing, code review practices.
* **Hardware & Deployment:** GPUs/TPUs, cloud vs local tradeoffs, inference optimization.
* **Soft skills:** teamwork, clear communication, documentation, patience, and respect.

## 🧩 Example roles we need

* Research / Model Architects
* ML Engineers (training & evaluation)
* Low-level Engineers (C++ / performance)
* Data Engineers / Labelers
* Backend / DevOps (APIs, servers)
* Frontend / UX (dashboard, site)
* QA / Testing / Security
* Designer / Product thinker

## ⚙️ How we’ll work (rules & workflow)

* **No payment for now.** This is a passion project. When we launch, we will share profits fairly among contributors.
* **Meetings:** We plan **10 online meetings per month**. The team collectively decides the meeting days and times; we will pick slots that consider the project lead’s school schedule. Scheduling is a team decision.
* **Team decisions:** No single person decides alone — we discuss, argue respectfully, and vote when needed.
* **Respect:** No childish drama, no bossy behavior. Everyone’s voice matters.
* **Commitment:** Join only if you’re ready to stay and build trust — don’t drop out mid-way.
* **Learning culture:** Pair-programming, code reviews, mentoring, and shared study sessions are encouraged.
